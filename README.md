# Rustboy

This is a fun project for me, nothing serious. I don't think the world needs another Gameboy emulator. 
After starting out with a CHIP8 Emulator, this seemed like the next reasonable challenge for me. Expect
sloppy code and bad (emulating) practices since I'm a total noob!

# TODOS

## Emulator
* Basic Implementation
* External features (savestates, fast forward etc.)
* Accurate Implementation
* Add GUI
* Migrate modules to traits for extendability

## CI/CD
* Format
* Lint
* Release
